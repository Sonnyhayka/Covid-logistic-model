# Covid-logistic-model
This project analyzes infection dynamics across different countries using parameters derived from real data. It visualizes the total number of infections over 31 days using 2D and 3D plots with Matplotlib. Key findings include the saturation point and rate of spread for each country based on varying infection rates and population limits.
